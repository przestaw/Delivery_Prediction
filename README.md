## Features

- model training
- models exporting & loading
- serving predictions by *flask* restful api
- A/B experiment 
- prediction summary

## Research

In */notebooks* subfolder there are *IPython* notebooks with data exploration and models comparison steps of our project

## Demonstration

  Demo script utilizing curl *run_curl_demo.sh* executes scenario :
  1. request authors information
  2. load knn model
  3. list models
  4. get prediction
  5. load tree model
  6. configure A/B *(A as tree B as knn)*
  7. activate A/B experiment
  8. get prediction 
  9. get prediction
  10. disable A/B
  11. set tree model as current model
  12. get prediction history
  13. get prediction summary (with responses of all models)
